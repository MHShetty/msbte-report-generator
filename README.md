# msbte-report-generator
A GUI-based application written in Java that can generate a excel spreadsheet (report) for a given sample link and set of enrollment nos. for MSBTE affiliated colleges.

Please ensure that the latest JDK version is installed and is the most prioritized in PATH (environment variable) in order to run this project.

On Windows this project can be either run using either using **run.bat** or **ReportGenerator.vbs**.

On Linux and other platforms, you could just copy the last line of the run.bat file and everything should work fine (if the system supports GUI and is not purely based on CLI)

Also, please avoid using WSL on Windows to run this program and instead directly run it on Windows unless you have made some explicit setup for the GUI (it isn't present by default)

Don't forget to star this repository if it helps you ;)
